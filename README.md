# tourenbuchctl
A tool for working with my tourenbuch.

Tourenbuch is a set of my personal outdoor sports activity. Each entry consists
of gpx tracks, a map, stats, plotted elevation graphs and a overall summary.

## Strava
Activity stats like distance or climbed elevation gets queried from strava and
parsed in the Tourenbuch.
